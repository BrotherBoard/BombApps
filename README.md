Some android apps i made, which i find useful (for me)
To get my apps after nuking I just git clone this, so this is like a cloud for me.
They are more advanced than they look, and being updated w new features.

Included:

Battery Level Changer: do u need an explanation? needs root

Complex Power: some app to calculate i^Y=X for me

CameraFeature Tweaks: for tweaking camera-feature.xml in rooted samsung devices, yes rooted and not erofs or enforcing please.

DecimalBatteryDeprecated: Testing app, it is deprecated and uses root.
